## Decription 


## Requirements 
To use the routine, you need to have installed the 'jwst' module for reducing JWST data. If this is not the case, please refer to: https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html

## Installation 
To use the correction routine, the easiest way is to save the 'remBgdNoise.py' file in the directory containing your data reduction code. Otherwise, pay attention to the directory tree of your files when you want to import the functions into your main file.
